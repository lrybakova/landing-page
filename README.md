The project is an example of adaptive web-page with dynamically built navigation. When new section is added the navigation bar is being populated with new item. Each menu item has an anchor link to the section at the page and when being clicked scrolls page smoothly towards the appropriate section. When section get close to screen's top it is being highlighted with different background and animations. Also, dedicated menu item is being highlighted when corresponding section is shown in viewport, both, after click or when user scrolls the page. It helps to understand which section is being viewed. Functionality works and looks good both on PC and mobile screens. Done without any frameworks.
